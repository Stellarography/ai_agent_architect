Okay, let's continue from the end of the previous revision (after Prompt 12) and integrate Shadcn UI, then build the new layout structure.

Important Consideration: Adding Shadcn UI introduces its own component library and styling conventions (based on Tailwind CSS and CSS Variables). This will likely mean:

Styling Strategy Shift: You'll probably rely more on Shadcn components and Tailwind utilities, potentially reducing the need for custom Styled Components for basic UI elements like buttons, inputs, etc.

Component Redundancy: The custom Button.tsx created in Prompt 12 might become less used or replaced entirely by Shadcn's Button (@/components/ui/button).

Theming: Shadcn uses CSS variables for theming, configured during its initialization. This might overlap or conflict with the ThemeProviderComponent and theme.ts from Styled Components (Prompt 9). You'll need to decide how to manage themes â€“ primarily via Shadcn's CSS variables or maintain both systems.

We will proceed assuming you want to adopt Shadcn UI and its components where applicable.

Prompt 13: Install Shadcn UI CLI

Install the Shadcn UI command-line interface as a development dependency using npm:

```bash
npm install -D shadcn-ui@latest

-------

**Prompt 14: Initialize Shadcn UI**

```prompt
Initialize Shadcn UI in your project. Run the following command in your terminal and follow the prompts carefully:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Make the following selections when prompted (or adjust as needed):

Would you like to use TypeScript?: Yes

Which style would you like to use?: Default (or New York)

Which color would you like to use as base color?: Slate (or choose another like Gray, Zinc) - This sets up the CSS variables.

Where is your global CSS file?: src/index.css (Verify this is where your @tailwind base; directives are)

Do you want to use CSS variables for colors?: Yes (This is standard for Shadcn theming)

Where is your tailwind.config.js located?: tailwind.config.js (Confirm the path)

Configure import alias for components:: @/components (Standard alias)

Configure import alias for utils:: @/lib/utils (Standard alias)

Are you using React Server Components?: No (For a Vite client-side app)

Important Notes:

This command will modify your tailwind.config.js, src/index.css (or your global CSS file), and potentially vite.config.ts (for path aliases). It will also create components.json and src/lib/utils.ts.

Review the changes made to these files after initialization, especially tailwind.config.js and src/index.css, to ensure they merged correctly with your previous setup.

Potential Conflict: This setup introduces CSS variable-based theming. This might conflict with or make your existing Styled Components ThemeProviderComponent and theme.ts less relevant for overall app theming, especially for Shadcn components. You may need to refactor or remove the Styled Components theme toggling later if you fully adopt Shadcn's theming.

**Prompt 15: Add Required Shadcn UI Components**

Execute the following commands to install the necessary Shadcn UI components, organized by their functional categories:

```bash
# Basic Interface Components - Essential UI elements
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button      # Core interactive element
npx shadcn-ui@latest add separator   # Visual divider
npx shadcn-ui@latest add sheet       # Slide-out panels
npx shadcn-ui@latest add dropdown-menu # Contextual menus
npx shadcn-ui@latest add avatar      # User profile images

# Form Components - Input and control elements
npx shadcn-ui@latest add input       # Text input fields
npx shadcn-ui@latest add label       # Form field labels
npx shadcn-ui@latest add select      # Dropdown selections
npx shadcn-ui@latest add checkbox    # Toggle checkboxes
npx shadcn-ui@latest add switch      # Toggle switches

# Navigation & Layout Components - Structure and navigation
npx shadcn-ui@latest add card        # Content containers
npx shadcn-ui@latest add scroll-area # Scrollable regions
npx shadcn-ui@latest add tabs        # Content organization
npx shadcn-ui@latest add tooltip     # Contextual help

# Feedback Components - User interaction and notifications
npx shadcn-ui@latest add dialog      # Modal windows
npx shadcn-ui@latest add alert       # Status messages
npx shadcn-ui@latest add toast       # Temporary notifications
```

These components will be used throughout the application for:
- Basic UI interactions and controls
- Form handling and user input
- Layout structure and navigation
- User feedback and notifications
- Modal interfaces and overlays

**Note:** After installation, these components will be available in the `@/components/ui/` directory, following the path alias configured during Shadcn UI initialization.

-------

**Prompt 16: Refactor Layout Component Structure**

```prompt
Now, let's significantly refactor the `src/components/Layout.tsx` component to implement the new structure with a top navbar, left sidebar, main content area, and right sidebar using Tailwind CSS for layout and incorporating Shadcn components where appropriate.

Replace the entire content of `src/components/Layout.tsx` with the following:

```typescript
// src/components/Layout.tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Link, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Cpu, Menu, X, Settings, Bell, User } from 'lucide-react';
// Import Shadcn components
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"; // Use Shadcn Button
import { Sheet, SheetContent, SheetTrigger, SheetClose } from "@/components/ui/sheet"; // For mobile menu/sidebar
import { Separator } from "@/components/ui/separator";
import { Avatar, AvatarFallback, AvatarImage } from "@/components/ui/avatar";
import {
  DropdownMenu,
  DropdownMenuContent,
  DropdownMenuItem,
  DropdownMenuLabel,
  DropdownMenuSeparator,
  DropdownMenuTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/dropdown-menu";

...

Self-Correction: Initially placed Footer outside the main content column, but it makes more sense within it for proper scrolling and layout across screen sizes. Adjusted the grid structure (grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto]) and placed Navbar/Main/Footer within the second column (col-start-1 md:col-start-2). Used Shadcn's Sheet for the mobile sidebar.

**Layout Structure Correction:**

1. Previous Layout Issue:
   - Footer was positioned outside the main content column
   - Scrolling behavior wasn't optimal across screen sizes

2. Improved Layout Structure:
   - Grid layout with `grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto]` for better organization
   - Components arranged in the second column using `col-start-1 md:col-start-2`:
     - Navbar (auto height)
     - Main content (flexible height)
     - Footer (auto height)
   - Mobile sidebar using Shadcn's Sheet component for smooth transitions

This revised structure ensures:
- Proper content scrolling behavior
- Consistent layout across different screen sizes
- Better mobile responsiveness with Sheet component
- Clean separation of navigation and content areas

-------

**Prompt 17: (Verification) Update AppRoutes**

```prompt
Verify that your `src/router/AppRoutes.tsx` is still correctly using the `Layout` component to wrap the `Routes`. It should look similar to this (no changes likely needed from Step 4 of the previous response, but good to confirm):

```typescript
// src/router/AppRoutes.tsx (Verification)
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import Layout from '../components/Layout'; // Import the refactored Layout
// ... import page components ...
import HomePage from '../pages/HomePage';
import AgentManagementPage from '../features/agent-management/pages/AgentManagementPage';
...

Prompt 18: (Verification) Update HomePage

Verify that your `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` primarily contains the content specific to the home page (like the Hero, Features, CTA sections) and does *not* include its own header/footer/sidebar structure, as the `Layout` component now provides that.

No code changes are likely needed in `HomePage.tsx` itself if it was correctly implemented in the previous steps (containing only the `<main>` content, now wrapped in a Fragment `<>...</>`).

Prompt 19: Revisit Styling Strategy & Cleanup

Now that Shadcn UI is integrated and the layout uses its components:

1.  **Review Styling Strategy:** Acknowledge the shift. Prioritize using Shadcn components (`@/components/ui/*`) and Tailwind utility classes for UI elements. The custom Styled Components (`Button.tsx`, potentially others) might be deprecated or reserved for highly custom elements not covered by Shadcn.
2.  **Theme Management:** Decide if you will primarily use Shadcn's CSS variable theming (managed via `globals.css`/`index.css` and potentially a theme toggle script interacting with CSS variables) or if you still need the Styled Components `ThemeProviderComponent` for non-Shadcn components.
    *   **Recommendation:** For simplicity, try relying on Shadcn's theming first. You might be able to remove or simplify `src/styles/ThemeProviderComponent.tsx` and `src/styles/theme.ts`. The theme toggle button in the old `ThemeProviderComponent` would need to be replaced with one that toggles the `dark` class on the `<html>` element, which Shadcn's CSS variables use.
3.  **Global Styles:** Review `src/styles/GlobalStyle.ts`. Remove any base styles (like body background, color, font-family) that are now handled by Shadcn's setup in `src/index.css` to avoid conflicts. Keep only truly *global* custom styles that complement Shadcn.
4.  **Cleanup:** Remove the old custom `Button.tsx` (Prompt 12) if you are fully switching to Shadcn's button. Remove the old `ThemeProviderComponent.tsx` and `theme.ts` (Prompt 9) if adopting Shadcn's theming.

*Execute the necessary cleanup steps based on your decision.* For example, to remove the old theme files:
`Remove the files src/styles/ThemeProviderComponent.tsx and src/styles/theme.ts. Update src/App.tsx to remove the ThemeProviderComponent wrapper. Update src/styles/GlobalStyle.ts to remove theme dependencies and conflicting base styles.`

*To implement Shadcn dark mode toggle (example):*
`Add a dark mode toggle using Shadcn's DropdownMenu or a Button in the Navbar. Use a library like 'next-themes' (adapted for Vite/React) or simple localStorage logic to add/remove the 'dark' class to the root HTML element.`
